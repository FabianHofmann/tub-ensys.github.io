## Our Research

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing society today. Tackling
this challenge will require a complete reorganisation of the infrastructure
necessary to satisfy our energy needs: electricity generators, storage, energy
networks, heating supply, transport and industrial processes. In Europe hundreds
of billions of euros of spending per year are at stake, and we do not have time
to correct misallocations of investment before climate change takes effect.
Accurate modelling and simulation of future energy systems are therefore
crucial.

Our group leverages cutting-edge research from a variety of disciplines to
understand the most cost-effective pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
in the energy system. This involves building models of the energy system and
optimising the investment in and operation of the necessary infrastructure.
Maintaining sufficient model detail and interdependencies is crucial to avoid
misallocation of investment and bad policy advice, but it also presents an
extreme computational challenge.

To tackle this challenge we're developing new algorithms and methodologies so
that we can capture these details in a manageable way and therefore provide the
best possible policy guidance for the transition to a sustainable energy future.

In particular we focus on:

    - How to reduce emissions in all energy sectors, including electricity, transport, heating and industry
    - The requirements for electricity grid reinforcement with large shares of wind and solar generation, and increased energy trade
    - Using sectoral integration to reduce the need for transmission grid reinforcement
    - Understanding where model details and interdependencies are important and where they're not
    - Heuristics that mimic full-system optimisation but are easier to analyse and explain
    - Near-optimal solutions that are cost-effective but achieve high levels of public acceptance
    - Open source software and open data to enhance transparency and reproducibility
