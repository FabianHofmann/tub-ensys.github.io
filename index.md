## Our Research

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing society today. Tackling
this challenge will require a complete reorganisation of the infrastructure
necessary to satisfy our energy needs: electricity generators, storage, energy
networks, heating supply, transport and industrial processes. In Europe hundreds
of billions of euros of spending per year are at stake, and we do not have time
to correct misallocations of investment before climate change takes effect.
Accurate modelling and simulation of future energy systems are therefore
crucial.

Our group leverages cutting-edge research from a variety of disciplines to
understand the most cost-effective pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
in the energy system. This involves building models of the energy system and
optimising the investment in and operation of the necessary infrastructure.
Maintaining sufficient model detail and interdependencies is crucial to avoid
misallocation of investment and bad policy advice, but it also presents an
extreme computational challenge.

To tackle this challenge we're developing new algorithms and methodologies so
that we can capture these details in a manageable way and therefore provide the
best possible policy guidance for the transition to a sustainable energy future.

## Current Research Projects

### Integration of hydrogen and carbon management into energy system models

Funder: [Breakthrough Energy Sciences](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/)

Duration: 01.10.2021 - 30.09.2024

Topic: The goal is to improve the representation of hydrogen and
carbon management in highly-resolved energy system models for the
United States and Europe. This will allow us to carry out research
into the future role of clean hydrogen and carbon capture in deep
decarbonization scenarios. All code and research data will be made
freely available with open source licences.

### 24/7 carbon-free power purchase agreements

Finder: [Google](https://www.google.com/)

Duration: 01.11.2021 - 31.01.2024

Topic: Traditional Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for renewable
energy have seen rapid growth in recent years, but they only match
supply and demand on average over a longer period such as a
year. There is increasing interest from corporations such as Google to
match their demand with clean energy supply on a truly 24/7 basis,
whether that is using variable renewables paired with storage, or
using dispatchable clean sources such as geothermal power. In 2020
Google committed to operating entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy
(CFE) at all of its data centres and campuses worldwide by 2030.  In
this project we will explore different designs for a 24/7 carbon-free
PPA, and how their deployment affects the rest of the energy system.
